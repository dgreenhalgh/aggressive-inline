# Aggressive Inline
## Higher-Order Functions in Kotlin

---

# Functions are first class citizens in Kotlin

---

# Simplest case, Java

```java
public class Sample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Do something
  }
}
```

---

# Simplest case, Kotlin

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  // Do something
}
```

---

# Function types

```kotlin
```

# Lambda calculus

---

# Origins of lambda calculus

---

# Functions as black boxes

---

# What does lambda calculus look like in Kotlin syntax?

---

# The arrow operator

```kotlin
```

---

# Storing references to functions

```kotlin
```

---

# Passing functions as arguments to other functions

```kotlin
```

---

# Origins of higher-order functions

---

# Last parameter trick // Provide proper name

---

# Domain-specific languages

---

# Interoperability

---

# Java's Function type

```java
```

---

# Higher-order function in Java

```java
```

---

# Last parameter trick in Java // rename

```java
```

---

# Domain-specific language in Java

```java
```

# Performance implications of function types

* Additional object allocation

---

# Function inlining

Fold higher-order function into call site

* inline
* noinline
* crossline

---

# Functional programming
